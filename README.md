Form Input data validation library with form

#add class in input tag as follows:

if input is require feild then add "fieldRequired" as className in that input.
if input is number feild then add "numberRequired" as className in that input.
if input is email feild then add "emailRequired" as className in that input.

Style them as per your need by slecting that element by its parent as I do in this files
